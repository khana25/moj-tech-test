## Other Instructions regarding the Technical Test

* I tried to finish this project as I have time constraint  and managing a UAT and Live release during the handing over my work to the TEST/QA team and the frontend developers community. I'm finishing my current contract by the end of this week

* I think I could have done better in different ways or with different languages

* My other work that I've been practising and doing some work in my free time:  https://github.com/khana25/

Many Thanks for giving me the opportunity and considering me for the role
